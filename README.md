**Ever needed a creative 404 page?**  

This tiny API returns random, hilarious, and sometimes poetic reasons why a page wasn't found.  

*Perfectly suited for custom error pages, bots, dev tools, or just for laughs.*


Built for **missing pages**, **abroken links**, and **humor**.

**Based on the original [No-as-a-Service](https://github.com/hotheadhacker/no-as-a-service) by [hotheadhacker](https://github.com/hotheadhacker)**.  
A huge thank you for the inspiration and the groundwork! 🙏
